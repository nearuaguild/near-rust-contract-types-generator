<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This example demonstrates the process of generating TypeScript typed files based on Near Protocol smart contract

- `main` branch contains plain contract with an example of generator usage

- `only_generator` branch contains script for generating types & example of output in `/type_generator/example/typescript`

### Pros

- Contract public functions are automatically generated
- Output type file contains `Contract` class with all functions

### Cons

- Custom `struct` and `enum` must be decorated with proc macro `#[witgen]`
- Type `&str` is not supported (but you can use `String`)

### Built With

- [![Rust][rust]][rust-url]
- [witgen (v0.15.0)](https://docs.rs/witgen/latest/witgen/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

ðŸ’¡ _Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed_

- [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
- [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo#compiling-from-source)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git/)

### Installation

Follow these simple instructions to setup the required dependencies before usage

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/nearuaguild/near-rust-contract-types-generator.git
   ```
2. Checkout to branch `only_generator`
   ```sh
   git switch only_generator
   ```
3. Copy the folder to your project
   ```sh
   cp /type_generator/ /PATH_TO_YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT/
   ```
4. Add `witgen` lib to your dependencies in `Cargo.toml`
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   witgen = "0.15.0"
   ```
5. Install `witme` package
   ```sh
   cargo install witme --version 0.2.6 --force
   ```

---

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Follow these simple instructions to generate Typescript interface files

1. Import `witgen` crate to `lib.rs`

   ```rust
   use witgen::witgen;
   ```

2. Decorate with `#[witgen]` macro your contract types (example in `/src/lib.rs`)

   ```rust
   #[witgen]
   #[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize, Clone)]
   pub enum Kind {
      OK { code: u8 },
      FAIL { code: u8, text: String },
   }
   ```

   ```rust
   #[derive(BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize, PanicOnDefault, Clone)]
   #[witgen]
   pub struct Config {
      number: u16,
      kind: Kind,
   }
   ```

3. Execute script from the root smart contract folder
   ```sh
   ./type_generator/generate.sh
   ```
4. Copy generated types to your TypeScript project
   ```sh
   cp ./type_generator/typescript/ /PATH_TO_TYPESCRIPT_PROJECT/
   ```

<!-- CREATING ABI -->

## Creating an ABI

To create an ABI for a rust smart contract, follow these instructions:

1) Build the contract. In this example, create a new folder named /res, compile the smart contract into a wasm file by running
   
   ```sh
   ./build.sh
   ```

2) Deploy the contract

   ```sh
   near dev-deploy res/contract.wasm
   ```

3) Create the ABI

   ```sh
   cargo near abi
   ```

This will have created an ABI in the location target/near/near_rust_contract_types_generator_abi.json
If you want to use this ABI to interact with the contract quickly, you can use Pagoda.
To do this, link the account that you have deployed the contract to then attach the ABI
